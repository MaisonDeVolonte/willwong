# STUDY GUIDE: Short Title
one line 'big idea' description of the topic/feature/concept to be studied

- [ ] one line per file: what it is, why it's in this spot, one clause max

*example:*
> - [ ] `types.ts` is the shape everything downstream returns; read this first, always
> - [ ] `apis/source.ts` does raw fetch only, no formatting; the "one call, cache it" pattern
> - [ ] `aggregate.ts` does raw data becomes UI-ready strings here; the fail-soft pattern lives here
> - [ ] `Widget.tsx` is dumb consumer; if this file surprises you, the layer below did its job wrong

## Model
the one idea to walk away with, 1-3 lines, no more

*example:*
> raw source → per-source derivation → aggregate (format + cache + fail-soft) → dumb UI.
> every new stat repeats this exact chain — nothing skips a layer, nothing shares a fetch.

## Pattern
how to build the next similar thing, using this as the reference

*example:*
> 1. add the shape to `types.ts`
> 2. build one raw source under `apis/`, one job, no formatting
> 3. derive + format + cache in `aggregate.ts`
> 4. wire the dumb UI row last
