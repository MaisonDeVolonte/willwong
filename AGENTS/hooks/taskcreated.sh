# @description
# - fires on TaskCreated (a TaskCreate call registers a new task)
# - decision:"block" prevents the creation itself here, unlike
#   TaskCompleted — confirmed live, a blocked test task never got
#   created — so this uses additionalContext instead, non-blocking
# - creates today's log file if missing
# - nudges the agent to check thread-relatedness, not enforced
# @see AGENTS.md, AGENTS/logs.md, AGENTS/tasks.md, AGENTS/hooks.md
